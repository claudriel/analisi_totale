# Holograpy Analysis Tool

Holography Analysis Tool (HAT) is a featuring extraction framework for holography reconstructed images. 

Nowadays the framework is composed by a single python script that performed the areas extraction of each crystal from every reconstructed image. 
Into the images the crystals are authomatic extracted using one of the clustering algoritm provided by `scipy.ndimage` package.

Is also possible to get some statistical data about the average area of the crystals observed in a particular survay and a weight average of overall data of every survay. 

Package requirements:

1. `matplotlib`
2. `scipy`
3. `PIL`
4. `numpy`
